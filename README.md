This is version 2 android 1.1 
This can be found on the android market if you want to check it out.

The code probably needs to be refactored as I probably have a few duplications in the calculate.java since it performs
the same calculation for multiple classes.  I just used if/else if statements for this, but it ended up being
pretty long.  So, I eventually need to go back and change a few things to make it cleaner.

It has been manually tested and does not seem to have any noticable bugs.

enjoy!
